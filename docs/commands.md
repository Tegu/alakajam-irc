# Commands
Commands should be written in the form `<prefix><command> [...args]` and sent
either to the channel or in a private message. For example, with the default
`!` prefix, merely typing `!hype` will activate the `hype` command.

Each of the following commands is supported. Remember to add the prefix when
issuing them!

-   `hype` displays a countdown to the next significant event.
-   `find <user>` finds the most recent entry by a user.
-   `roll [...dice]` rolls a number of dice.
